== Slick with Spring Boot and  Scala

This project is simple sample about how use Slick with Scala and Spring Boot

Instead of use maven or gradle, I use sbt (tool for scala) with the necesarie dependencies.

=== Description ===

This project is a simple sample of the use of slick with spring boot. Slick has several features, althought
in this sample I just use some features of slick.
I use *Await* and *DBIO*, the first of them you shouldn't do in a real application because block the current
thread and wait for the database result.

This sample has two entities Car and Person with a CRUD, and the information will be returned in two controllers.

Car and person's information will be saved in a database in memory as H2, in the started of spring boot a person
and a car will be saved in two tables (person and car)

You can have a look into the code, and if you see any improve (surely yes), please do a pull request, thank you!


=== Run

```
$ sbt run
```

```
$ java -jar
```
